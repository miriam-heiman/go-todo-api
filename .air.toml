# Air Configuration File
# Air is a live-reload tool for Go applications that automatically rebuilds and restarts your server
# when you make changes to your code files. This eliminates the need to manually stop and restart
# the server during development. It watches for file changes (*.go files) and automatically recompiles
# and runs your application, making development faster and more convenient.
#
# To use: Run `air` in the terminal instead of `go run main.go`
